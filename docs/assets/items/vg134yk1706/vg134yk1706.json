All reconstructed wall and column measurements are based on the description and scaled plans and cross-section drawings in Martin, van Dijk, and Frazer (2012: 4–11, pls. 1, 1A, and 1C); the 3D model is a highly simplified version of the monument.The pylon towers were hypothesized to have reached 7–8m above pavement level; in the model, the pylon is raised to 7m. The portico columns in the outer courtyard stood 3.18m. The walls in the outer courtyard have been raised to ~4+m above pavement level, and the walls in chapels A and B have been raised to 3m above pavement level based on the surviving height of the vault spring at 2.1m. The statue room has been raised to the height of ~4m above pavement level based on the excavator’s assertion that the vault spring would have been higher than that of chapels A and B; the statue room has been left without a roof other than its vault, as the room is too wide to support a slab roof without additional support (for which no evidence remained). The columns of the inner courtyard were ~2.3m tall; the height of the inner courtyard walls was projected to have been ~2.8m above pavement level. The walls of the sanctuary (offering room D) and two side chapels (C and E) were reconstructed to ~2.25m above pavement level.The thickness of the mud-brick walls of the sanctuary (offering room D) led the excavators to conclude that the structure was originally capped with a mud-brick pyramid, whose height was hypothesized at ~7.25m; the pyramid’s full height (above the roof) could thus have been ~9.5m. Excavators suggested that inscribed stone slabs uncovered at the site were originally positioned on the pyramid, similar to a decorative detail from the stone pyramid of the tomb of Tia and Tia (2012: 40), so the mud-brick pyramid was textured with limestone to show that it may have been fully or partly cased in stone.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
