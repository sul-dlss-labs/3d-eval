The 3D model of the tomb is based on the descriptions, site photos, and ground plan in Raven et al. (2013). Two versions of the model (Dynasty 18 and Dynasty 19) are included here, as the monument experienced multiple significant phases of construction and deconstruction/redesign in the New Kingdom; the earlier represents the construction phase under the original owner, while the latter represents the tomb after the removal of the pyramid in late Dynasty 18 and the addition of new constructions on the east façade in Dynasty 19.The chapel’s walls and pyramid were composed of mud-brick, with only a few limestone architectural elements, including the doorjambs of the gateway and sanctuary. The central sanctuary and gateway entrance were paved with stone, but the floor of the courtyard was left unpaved. A large covered shaft to a burial chamber was situated in the center of the courtyard; its covering slabs and round-topped perimeter are included in the model. The original wall height of this tomb was unknown, as only the lower parts of the mud-brick walls were preserved; the 3D model therefore estimated the wall height based on that of the neighboring tombs of Meryneith and Ptahemwia (2.28m).The mud-brick pyramid surmounting the chapel was likely destroyed when the monument’s western walls were deconstructed, possibly to make room for the addition of a forecourt to the tomb of Pay and Raia, so its exact height and angle were unclear. In the 3D model, its size and height were based on the tomb of Paser, as the two tombs were similar in size.In Dynasty 19, a small limestone chapel with two thin papyrus columns was added to the east exterior of the tomb, and additional walls forming an exterior porch was added, changing the axis of the entrance to the tomb; the mud-brick wall that would have formed this porch may have had a wooden roof, but this (very hypothetical detail) was not added to the model.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
