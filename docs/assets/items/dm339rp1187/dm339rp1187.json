Because the 3D model for this project covers through Dynasty 30, the Phase I and IIa/b temple plans (2006: figs. 1–2) were used for the reconstruction; the building appears first in Dynasty 26, then expands in Dynasty 30. A number of areas of the temple led into rock-cut vaults or catacombs for animal burial; these areas are not included in the model.Only the most basic details of the temple enclosure for Phase I have been included in the model; reconstructions of all these elements were greatly simplified, with structures designed based on the plans, axonometric drawings, and suggested reconstructions of the excavators (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: fig. 1, 9). They suggested that Sanctuary A measured at least 5m in height, that the Precinct D wall stood at least 3.5m high from the level of the terrace below it, and that a difference of 1m spanned the floor of Terrace I and the level of the precincts. Excavators were unsure but suggested that a southern wall (Precinct B, mirroring the northern Precinct D wall) was present at this time (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: 16), and it is included here in the model; a mud-brick staircase (Stairway I) and terrace wall (approximately 1.95m wide at the top and slightly battered) built of mud-brick (with an upper portion of limestone blocks) fronted the west of the temple in Phase I, with the wall forming a terrace level (Terrace I) below the precinct and sanctuary. Its southern extension was also hypothesized by excavators and is thus included here (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: 42–43), although its exact form in Phase I is hypothetical. Sanctuary A was constructed measuring 12 x 11m, following the ground plan and dimensions listed in the publication (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: 23, fig. 1). The sanctuary’s stone gate (which the excavators suggested was added later in Phase II, although shown in their fig. 1) is not included, nor are any of the internal details of this building. The height of the sanctuary was hypothesized to reach 5m from the level of the threshold to the roof in the model based on the axonometric reconstruction drawing of the later form of the building (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: fig. 12) that includes the earlier core sanctuary structure. Gates B and D, on both sides of the sanctuary, are shown textured in stone, because the excavators suggested that they may have been present in Phase I, although they may be Phase II additions and mud-brick entrances at this time (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: 31).Major additions in Phase II include an enclosure on the north side of the precinct, an expansion of Sanctuary A to the west, and a gate added to the southern enclosure wall to allow for the entrance of a sacred way. Only the most basic details of the temple enclosure for Phases IIa and IIb have been included in the model, and reconstructions of all these elements were greatly simplified, with structures designed based on the plans, axonometric drawings, and suggested reconstructions of the excavators (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: 16–18 and figs. 2–3, 9, 11–12). Omitted details include elements of interior spaces, elaborate staircases, the stone causeways, a number of terrace chapels and porches, and the variety of variations in the level of the terrace around Sanctuary A.The stone gateways on the published reconstruction drawing (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: fig. 12) were included in the model using a single generic stone gate, resized to meet the base size as designated in the ground plan (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: fig. b), and these were not customized to replicate the original size and shape of the door jambs or cornices. Sanctuary A's expansion included new stone construction on the west and the facing of the original west façade of the mud-brick building (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: fig. 3). The stairway from Phase I was replaced with a ramp (Smith, Davies, and Frazer 2006: fig. 2).","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
