The 3D model reconstruction was based on the detailed plans, reconstruction drawings, and site photographs of Schneider et al. (2012: 31–35, figs. II.1, II.2a–b, II.3, II.4) and is a highly simplified version of the monument.The pyramid measured 4.5m x 4.5m at the base and was estimated to originally stand 6–7m tall (including a reddish-black granite pyramidion, 63cm tall) by Schnedier et al. (2012: 35, 77–78). In the model, the pyramid is visualized with a height of 6m.Chapel B consisted of a small antechapel with two stone papyriform columns, whose location in the model is based on the section drawings and representations of a tomb chapel as shown in Schneider et al. (2012: figs. II.2b and II.5). The original height of the columns, including base and abaci, was 152.5cm (Schneider et. al 2012: 75 and fig. III.25); this is reflected in the model, although the exact height and form of the interior chapel roof (which included lintels not shown in the section drawing II.2b) is unclear, so that part of the model is simplified and hypothetical.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
