The 3D model is based on the ground plan, site photos, and description of dimensions and materials in Raven et al. (2011: especially figs. 2–3).The original wall height of this tomb was unknown, as only the lower parts of the mud-brick walls were preserved; the 3D model therefore estimated the wall height based on that of the neighboring tombs of Meryneith and Ptahemwia (2.28m). The reconstruction includes the stone pilasters on the north and south side of the courtyard as well as the limestone dais in the rear of the central chapel. The tomb originally had a limestone paving, with the exception of the side chapels whose floors were packed mud; the side chapels had arched doorways and were vaulted.The tomb of Sethnakht was left unfinished during antiquity, and the model was designed to reflect that state. The open court was likely intended to include a small columned portico with roof on the west (never completed), so the model’s portico and rear sanctuary area lack the limestone roof that would have been added had the tomb been completed. The roof would also have covered the two side chapels with vaulted brick ceilings, which are represented here as complete, as some of the lower courses of the vaults were preserved.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
