on the plan of the tomb in Emery (1958: pl. 40). Emery did not suggest a reconstructed height for the superstructure; in the model it is estimated at ~4m to match with the hypothesized height of similarly sized monuments. Emery did not provide an exact height for the enclosure wall, so his scaled cross-section drawings were used to approximate the height at 0.9m. None of the the upper portions of the mastabas with exterior niching were preserved at Saqqara; the design of this part of the monument in the model is highly hypothetical, based on Early Dynastic palace façade imagery that shows some type of flat panel between the most deeply recessed niches, with the shallower niched areas extending higher, as visualized more elaborately in Emery (1954: pl. 39). Emery’s drawing (1958: pl. 45) showed that the superstructure over one of the subsidiary burials (3506-01) was 20cm high, with a rounded top and flat sloping sides, so this was used as a general model for all the subsidiary tombs, although other examples may have been shorter. A boat burial to the north was described by Emery as a “low tumulus,” 22.15m long, which he reconstructed to its maximum height) as standing ~1.2m tall, with a rounded brick superstructure (1958: pl. 41), so these dimensions were used for the visualization of the boat burial.In Dynasty 5, the mastaba (as well as all the Dynasty 1 mastaba tombs) is replaced in the model by a deflated ruin; any elaborate niching, polychrome paint, and enclosures are replaced by a solid rectangular structure, shorter than the original, to represent the possible melting and collapse of the brick structure. The exact dating and duration for this process is unclear, but Emery’s excavations show that in Dynasties 2–3 new tombs were already built against and even over the earliest structures, suggesting that the deflation process was rapid and certainly took place before the end of the Old Kingdom.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
