None of the interior details, such as possible interior temples (shown as blocks in fig. 62), central colonnades, doorways, or gateway embellishments were included in the 3D model; the 3D model is a highly simplified and standardized form of what would have been a very complex and irregular structure.The existence (or line) of a potential eastern outer enclosure wall along the valley floor was not established by the excavators. They noted that the east-west running walls could be open spur walls extending down to the valley floor; the structure would then be composed only of two north-south cross walls (Jeffreys, Smith, and Price 1988: 26). The eastern extension of the enclosure walls in the 3D model depict the line of those walls as recovered by the excavators, and it should be understood that the original extent of the walls to the east in ancient times remains unclear.The upper terrace area stands at around 60m ASL, with the lower terrace at 50m ASL, and the escarpment measured about 40m ASL at the point of the last documented part of the north enclosure wall on the east. The model was constructed to generally reflect this great change in elevation as the structure traced the slope of the escarpment down toward the valley floor.The model of the enclosure includes the two possible doorways (south of the Serapeum Way door) leading out of the temple's eastern wall, as suggested in Jeffreys, Smith, and Price (1988: fig. 62, neither of which is included in fig. 61).","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
