The tomb was constructed in three phases and expanded as the general gained power; the model version here shows the final stage of development and greatly simplifies the forms of the monument; the publication of Martin (1989: 7–132, pls. 5, 8–14) was used for the dimensions and ground plan of the core structure; Maarten Raven et al. (2011: 25–35, figs. I.4–I.6) was used for the reconstruction of the first pylon and forecourt.The height of Horemheb’s first (mud-brick) pylon is preserved to 3.15m in modern times. The pylon originally had an inward batter and was coated with mud-plaster; the original height remains unknown, and it is unclear if it was ever finished. In the model, it was visualized as a finished work, 7.65m tall, based on the size of the base; it was extended slightly higher than the second (stone) pylon, but this is highly speculative. Holes in the lower portion of the pylon were judged by the excavators to have been left by scaffolding. Only 1.3m of the original limestone gateway in the first pylon remains today; the original height of this feature was estimated in the model to extend ~20cm taller than the gate in the second pylon (5.3m vs. 5.1m). The forecourt was paved with limestone flooring and enclosed by a 2.3m tall mud-brick wall, the interior and exteriors of which were mud-plastered.The second pylon measured 7.5m, with an interior gate height of 5.1m (Martin 1989: fig. 12). The papyrus bundle columns in the peristyle outer court measured 3.23m (bottom of base to top of abacus), and those in the inner second court 2.26m (base to top of abacus) (Martin 1989: 22 and fig. 8). The axial reconstruction drawings suggested that the original height of the top of the roof line in the outer court (from floor level) measured ~4m, and that of the inner court and rear sanctuary area less than 3m; neither includes the higher height of torus molding extending up above the flat roof line (Martin 1989: pl. 8).The mud-brick pyramid that presumably sat atop the central chapel was destroyed when rear parts of the tomb were disassembled; the excavator’s reconstruction suggested that it may have extended ~7.75m tall above ground level (about 4.75m up from the roof line). Fragments of an uninscribed granite pyramidion were found by the excavators west of the tomb; it measured 66.5cm, was included in the excavator’s reconstructed height (Martin 1989: 8, fig. 18), and is included in the model here. The original exterior treatment of the period is unknown; it is shown here with a white plaster coating.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
