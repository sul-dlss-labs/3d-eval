the dimensions and descriptions of Lehner (1997: 17, 156-157) and Verner (2001: 342-348)Reconstructions of the pyramid temple, enclosures, and satellite pyramid were based on the plans and drawings of Lauer and Leclant (1972: plates XXXVII and XXXV), with the pyramid temple form highly simplified in the model; general heights from those reconstructions have been followed, with the enclosure wall measuring around 7m, in order to visualize the temple to the correct scale, but very little detail and no interior detail (with the exception of the pillars in the open courtyard) have been added to the model; the rounded top of the enclosure walls have been included to keep that visual aspect of the exterior structure; all doorways have been given a standard height of 3m, similar to the entrance door height shown in the axial plansThe complex’s causeway has not been fully excavated, and in the model it only extends part way down the escarpment, although it would have run further down to connect with a valley temple originally; the form of the causeway was based on that of Unas, and its position in the model is based on the plan of the initial meters in Lauer and Leclant (1972: pl. XXXV) and reflects general scholarly opinion that the causeway was directed to extend south of the existing pyramid to the east (Lepsius 29, possibly Menkauhor of Dynasty 5); the valley temple, whose original position is unknown, is not reconstructed in the modelThe pyramid form (in concert with all the Dynasty 4-6 pyramids in the model) alters to a deflating ‘ruin’ in the 3D model at the time-slide to Dynasty 18 (1548 BCE), approximately 1000 years after its construction in Dynasty 6; this does not correspond with a single destruction event in reality, but represents a general marker to the reader that many of the stone monuments of the Old Kingdom may have been naturally deflating or intentionally reused or their stone repurposed during the New Kingdom, see: Jaromir Málek, “A meeting of the old and new: Saqqara during the New Kingdom,” in Studies in Pharaonic religion and society: in honour of J. Gwyn Griffiths, ed.
