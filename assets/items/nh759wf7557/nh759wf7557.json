The ground plan in Jeffreys, Smith, and Price (1988: fig. 1) was used for the general shape and size of the monument; the enclosure was given a height similar to that of the Anubieion (8m with a 10m gateway on the north and a 12m gate on the south, which is called “massive” by the excavators).No interior details such as the possible interior temples or interior walls were included in the 3D model. The extension of the south wall to the east (downslope) was based on the projected line suggested by Jeffreys, Smith, and Price (1988: fig. 1). Similar to the neighboring Anubieion, the eastern extension of the enclosure walls in the 3D model depict the line of those walls as recovered by the excavators, and it should be understood that the original extent of the walls to the east in ancient times remains unclear. The existence (or line) of a potential eastern outer enclosure wall along the valley floor was not established by the excavators.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
