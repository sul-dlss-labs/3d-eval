Emery did not suggest a reconstructed height for the superstructure; in the model it is estimated at 6m because of its extremely large footprint. None of the the upper portions of the mastabas with exterior niching were preserved at Saqqara; the design of this part of the monument in the model is highly hypothetical, based on Early Dynastic palace facade imagery that shows some type of flat panel between the most deeply recessed niches, with the shallower niched areas extending higher, as visualized more elaborately in Emery (1954: pl. 39). A low bench (.60m wide and .45m wide) ran around all four sides of the original tomb superstructure; the tomb enclosure wall was constructed to a hypothetical 1m height based on Emery’s scaled drawings (pl. 1). The north wall was designed to be .75m.Sixty-two subsidiary graves surrounded the tomb according to Emery (1954: 13). These graves are presented by Emery as having a maximum height of 0.4m, so a generalized form for these tombs (including a small niche on one side) was created to match these dimensions (with a body of 0.25m high, with an arch extending an additional 0.15m tall) and repeated around the tomb.In Dynasty 5, the mastaba (as well as all the Dynasty 1 mastaba tombs) is replaced in the model by a deflated ruin; any elaborate niching, polychrome paint, and enclosures are replaced by a solid rectangular structure, shorter than the original, to represent the possible melting and collapse of the brick structure. The exact dating and duration for this process is unclear, but Emery’s excavations show that, in Dynasties 2–3, new tombs were already built against and even over the earliest structures, suggesting that the deflation process was rapid and certainly took place before the end of the Old Kingdom.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
