Emery did not suggest a reconstructed height for the superstructure but noted that the base dado of the painted design ended at 0.75m above ground level (which implies that the design extended much higher), and that the \"vast quantity\" of collapsed brick around the pavement suggested \"the collapse of a structure of considerable height\" (1954: 140); the model reconstruction thus visualizes the superstructure to ~6m. None of the the upper portions of the mastabas with exterior niching were preserved at Saqqara; the design of this part of the monument in the model is highly hypothetical, based on Early Dynastic palace facade imagery that shows some type of flat panel between the most deeply recessed niches, with the shallower niched areas extending higher, as visualized more elaborately in Emery (1954: pl. 39). The subsidiary burials that surrounded the superstructure consisted of pits with wooden roofing; their shape and height was based on the reconstruction drawing of Emery (1954: pl. 39).The tomb included a boat burial located to the north, the boat situated parallel with the north side of tomb. The preserved superstructure of the boat burial measured 17.75m x 4.25m x 0.8m (high).In Dynasty 5, the mastaba (as well as all the Dynasty 1 mastaba tombs) is replaced in the model by a deflated ruin; any elaborate niching, polychrome paint, and enclosures are replaced by a solid rectangular structure, shorter than the original, to represent the possible melting and collapse of the brick structure. The exact dating and duration for this process is unclear, but Emery’s excavations show that, in Dynasties 2–3, new tombs were already built against and even over the earliest structures, suggesting that the deflation process was rapid and certainly took place before the end of the Old Kingdom.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
