II) of pyramid precinct was used for most aspects of reconstruction of the enclosures and satellite pyramid (but see below for size of enclosure walls); the pyramidion was recovered during excavations and was made of black granite, and measured 1.3m high; Jéquier did not give a possible height for the satellite pyramid, so its height in the model (18.5m) was designated at approximately 1/2 the height of the main pyramid, based on the relationship between the base sizes of the two monuments at approximately 2:1Jéquier (1933) provided measurements for the mud-brick outer enclosure, which differ slightly from his published ground plan, so the stated measurements (and not the ground plan) were followed in the model; the inner wall Jéquier described as constructed with stone, 2m wide and 2.5m high, with inward sloping sides, his drawings of that wall include a rounded top and a series of niches on the exterior which were details not include in the model (1933: 7-8, fig. 7)Jequier (1933: 4) noted that the pyramid temple included a columned hall or portico with columns measuring approximately 4m tall, so this height is used for the reconstruction of the temple as an approximation of the original height; the outer enclosure wall was (hypothetically) given the same height; a hypothetical door was added to the east face of the outer enclosure, positioned in the center of the pyramid temple to show a possible point of entrance, although the incredibly poor state of preservation of the pyramid temple leaves the original form of the entrance unclearThe pyramid form (in concert with all the Middle Kingdom pyramids in the model) alters to a deflating ‘ruin’ in the 3D model at the time-slide to Dynasty 26 (672 BCE), approximately 1000+ years after its construction; this does not correspond with a single destruction event in reality, but represents a general marker to the reader that many of the stone monuments of the Middle Kingdom may have been naturally deflating or intentionally reused or their stone repurposed by this point","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
