The reconstructed models are therefore based on the ground plan of the area provided by Lacher-Raschdorff (2014: plan 2) and the plan and descriptions published by Tawfik (1991), with 3D aspects (including estimated heights of the superstructures) based on the neighboring New Kingdom tombs of similar superstructure and style at the site, especially those of Horemheb, Tia and Tia, Meryneith, and Maya and Meryt. The estimated superstructure heights generally range from 2.10m (the walls of the tripartite chapels of smaller tombs) to 3m (the main court walls of medium to large tombs).The heights of pylons were estimated using a formula that depends on the length and width of the pylon base; these average 3–6m in height. Pyramid height, where applicable, was also based on the general dimensions of the tomb superstructure as a whole, with the angles ranging from 60–65 degrees and generally reaching 5–6.6m. Column design is minimal and includes only the most basic circular or rectangular form; minimalist cavetto cornices have been added to likely locations such as chapel entryways. The eastern side of the main pylon or wall structure often features a portico-style porch or entry area in the temple tombs. When applicable, roofing has been added to represent areas that were likely covered.For those sites still largely unexcavated, only the features defined by the ground plan are reconstructed. Those features thought likely but not confirmed by Tawfik (dotted lines) are included in the reconstruction (with reduced opacity in the downloadable models). Additional structures (although likely) were not added to the model.The many contemporary tomb shafts indicating additional burials in the area are not included in the model.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
