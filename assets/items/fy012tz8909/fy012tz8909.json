off-axis entry to an open courtyard, a vestibule, a peristyle inner court with vaulted chambers in all four corners, and a central sanctuary with two columns capped by a stone pyramid; the 3D model of this tomb was based on the descriptions, plans, and site photographs in Raven et al. (2014: 57-71, fig. III.3), with the multiple phases of construction simplified down to a single moment, including the ‘phase 4’ opening of an entrance on the south wall of the courtyard; the 3D model is a highly simplified version of the monumentThe floor level of the tomb enclosure and mud-plaster forecourt were raised 20cm to lie at the same level of the peristyle court (Raven et al. 2014: 63). The thickness of the eastern wall of the east chapels measured 1.33m, in contrast with the north, south, and west walls (.5m–.8m thick). The western entrance façade had a slight angle, so the excavators concluded that a pylon-like entrance would have been located on the east side (Raven et al. 2014: 63); the eastern exterior wall of the tomb has been raised to 3.89m in a pseudo-pylon form to accommodate this theory, the hypothetical height calculated through comparison with another Dynasty 18 tomb at Saqqara (Tia and Tia). The width of the vestibule was too great to have been roofed with limestone slabs, so it was left uncovered (although Raven et al. 2014: 69 suggested that wood was a possible roof option). The exterior walls of the tomb are reconstructed at 2.84m (although the original height was unknown) based on the height of the preserved columns (measuring 2.24m from base to abacus), with an addition of .6m of roofing in some model locations.A plinth has been included in the pyramid structure, in the style of Tia and Tia’s pyramid; the form and position of the pyramid is based on Raven et al.
