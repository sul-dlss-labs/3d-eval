appearance of this monument; Verner (2001: 292-293, 297) described the pyramid as intentionally enlarged, and intended to be transformed into a true pyramid from a step pyramid core, but suggested that Neferirkare’s successor (Niuserre) had to complete work on this pyramid (as it was not finished at the king's death), and the casing was left incomplete and a causeway and valley temple were never added; Krejci (2010: 124) noted that the height to which the casing for the “true” pyramid sides actually reached remains unknown, and it may have appeared as a step-pyramid; Lehner’s pyramid dimensions were utilized (with a slope of 54 degrees) were utilized for the visualization of the completed straight-sided (albeit without casing stones) pyramid (1997: 17, 144-145); The pyramid’s step core had eight steps, measuring ~56m high, and the second (alternative) version of the model (not shown in the web-viewer) is based on the Verner drawing of the stepped core (Verner 2001: 292)A simple pyramid form (without any additional structures) was added to the model to represent the visual impact of large monuments at Abusir from the core Saqqara area; no additional details (including the brick perimeter wall which enclosed the mortuary temple and pyramid, or the wooden boat burials) were added to the modelThe pyramid form (in concert with all the Dynasty 4-6 pyramids in the model) alters to a deflating ‘ruin’ in the 3D model at the time-slide to Dynasty 18 (1548 BCE), approximately 1000 years after its construction in Dynasty 5; this does not correspond with a single destruction event in reality, but represents a general marker to the reader that many of the stone monuments of the Old Kingdom may have been naturally deflating or intentionally reused or their stone repurposed during the New Kingdom, see: Jaromir Málek, “A meeting of the old and new: Saqqara during the New Kingdom,” in Studies in Pharaonic religion and society: in honour of J. Gwyn Griffiths, ed. Alan B Lloyd (London: Egypt Exploration Society, 1992), 60, 65-73; inscribed blocks from the Unas causeway and other Old Kingdom monuments have been identified as reused in the New Kingdom temple tombs by their recent excavators (see Section 2)","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
