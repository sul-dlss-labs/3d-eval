The enclosure walls are generally dated to Nectanebo I, and the temple to Nectanebo II. The estimated size and form of the Serapeum enclosure was designed based on the plan in Mariette (1882: vol. 1), the plan of the dromos, eastern temple of Nectanebo II, and entrance to the Serapeum on the plan in Lauer and Picard (1955: pl. 1), and the hypothetical reconstruction of the Egyptian-style shrine on the dromos from Lauer and Picard (1955: pl. 17). The presence of a southern and western enclosure wall remains hypothetical (and is so indicated on Mariette's map), so those have been reconstructed in the suggested location in the model, but the exact size and location of these walls remains uncertain.Only the Late Period elements of the Serapeum were modeled; the Greek and Roman period additions (including the hemicircle of philosophers, a Greek chapel along the north dromos wall, and other structures) were not included. Elisabeth David, “Processional Way of Sphinxes,” 2016, http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/processional-way-sphinxes suggested that the sphinxes originally assigned by Mariette to the Late Period are instead dated to the early Ptolemaic Period (Ptolemy I or II), so they were not included in the model.The plan of Lauer and Picard (1955: pl. 1) documented a series of additional mud-brick service buildings located to the south and west (and presumably associated with) the Nectanebo II complex. Due to lack of information on their form or appearance, they were not included in the model.Based on comparative monuments, Dieter Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 8 pl. III suggested that a series of temples would have stood within the Serapeum enclosure walls. There would also have been a series of monumental gateways along the east-west axis and the north-south axis, as well as a large gateway and building along the north enclosure wall (where in the model only a stone gateway is currently reconstructed) that leads to a pathway linked to the sacred animal necropolis. None of his hypothesized structures are included in the model due to lack of detail on their form or exact position.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
