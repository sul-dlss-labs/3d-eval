I, fig. 2) which gives base a size of 19m but was based on incomplete excavations; Hawass's (2000: 414-416) re-examination of the monument suggested this was originally designed as a mastaba, then in the following reign (Pepy I) converted into a pyramid with memorial temple; we have only included the final development (the pyramid) form in the model, but labeled it for the reign of Teti, but since both kings are Dynasty 6 it does not impact its appearance in the model chronologyNone of the additional interior structures (pyramid chapel or storage buildings) were included in the modelThe pyramid form (in concert with all the Dynasty 4-6 pyramids in the model) alters to a deflating ‘ruin’ in the 3D model at the time-slide to Dynasty 18 (1548 BCE), approximately 1000 years after its construction in Dynasty 6; this does not correspond with a single destruction event in reality, but represents a general marker to the reader that many of the stone monuments of the Old Kingdom may have been naturally deflating or intentionally reused or their stone repurposed during the New Kingdom , see: Jaromir Málek, “A meeting of the old and new: Saqqara during the New Kingdom,” in Studies in Pharaonic religion and society: in honour of J.
