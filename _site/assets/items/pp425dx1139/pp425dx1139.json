Abb 3 and fig. 4) were used for the basic plan and hypothetical reconstruction of the model; Kawai (2012) described the structure as similar to a step or layer pyramid, but with cruder construction techniques; Yoshimura, Kawai,  Kashiwagi (2005:364-365) described it as “a rectangular platform or step terrace,” using local “rough” limestone blocks of varying size, averaging 30cm, with no casing, and with a 70 degree slope on the exterior face, made up of at least 3 layers with \"horizontal intervals...about 2.5m” (2005: 365), they reconstruct the original width of the structure as measuring some 20m in order to extend to the area of the shaft; Yoshimura, Kawai,  Kashiwagi (2005: abb 3) show axial plans of remaining structure, Section B suggested the monument would have extended some 9m high (if reaching the area of the shaft, as suggested in their reconstruction in their figure 4)The model was created as a simple massing model, following the suggested length (34m), width (20+m) (as shown in 2005: fig. 4), and height, the massing model includes four steps with inward tilt of 70 degrees on the three exterior steps, the exact width/depth of the layers was not fully clear (as the excavations dealt with a highly destroyed monument) so they are here only approximated based generally on the published plan; the model was left without the appropriate grade on its base, as this was instead created by the joining of it with the
