For the column paint, a digital photo of yellow painted relief in the tomb of Merynieth was sampled and placed onto the columns as a solid texture; the hypothesized mud-brick pyramid was given a texture to reflect that material, without a stone revetment or white plaster, and a pyramidion with a simple limestone texture (hypothesized) was placed at the top.

The model of the tomb was based on the description, plans, and site photographs in Martin et al. (1985: 10–15, pls. 2, 14–15).In modern times, Raia’s limestone chapel walls stand ~1.75 meters, which the excavators believed was close to the original height. Two limestone columns stood at the entrance to the chapel; the excavators believed that these columns were intended to support a small mud-brick pyramid on the roof, here reconstructed in a similar size to that of the tomb of Paser, with a small pyramidion, as suggested by the excavator Martin et al. (1985: 11) (although no evidence remains for its size or material). The original mud-brick enclosure wall around the open court was not well preserved; only the location of one of its walls was discovered, so it was not included in the model. A unique feature of the chapel of Raia is that the columns were covered in plaster and then painted yellow (with the floral base decoration painted red/brown, a detail not included in the model).","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
