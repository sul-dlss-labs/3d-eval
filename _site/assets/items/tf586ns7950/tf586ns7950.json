Lehner (1997: 84-85) was used for comparative information on shape, proportion and highly hypothetical building heightsLacher-Raschdorff does not suggest possible heights for this suggested reconstruction type, so heights from Djoser's step pyramid complex (which this hypothetical reconstruction is based on) were used in the 3D model, Djoser's enclosure wall is 10.5m, with the dome of the south tomb reaching to approximately this height, as reconstructed by Lehner (1997: 84-85), with the chapel of the south tomb reaching slightly lower, Ninetjer’s tomb heights and the dome of the tomb superstructure are thus modeled after these proportions and shapes; the massive Dynasty 2 funerary enclosures at Abydos (with walls 5m thick and surviving heights past 11m) suggest that the ~4m thick hypothesized walls of the tomb’s main superstructure could have supported buildings around the Djoser height, especially as these were filled with a sand and not hollow like the Abydos enclosures; the model palace is visualized at only 5m high, as the walls reimagined by Lacher-Raschdorff’s drawing (2014) were significantly thinner and thus suggest this would not have had the height of the tomb, the enclosure wall at the same height as the palace (also due to the thinner nature of the walls)Version 2: The superstructure of the mastaba was based on the form of the tomb of Shepseskaf, adjusted to reflect Lacher-Raschdorff 's suggested size (2014: Abb. 74); Lacher-Raschdorff suggested the structure was limestone, with a limestone facing, and a mud-brick enclosure with two doorways (west and east) and a mud-brick mortuary temple; no height designations were suggested by Lacher, so a height similar to those used in version 1 of the model (10.5m for the superstructure) was also utilized here; the mortuary temple was left highly schematic as a block with no detailsThe tomb disappears in the model in Dynasty 5, as scholars believe that the tomb superstructure may have been dismantled by king Unas, in order to construct his pyramid complex and causeway nearby: Claudia Lacher, “The Tomb of Ninetjer at Saqqara,” in Egypt at Its Origins 3: Proceedings of the Third International Conference “Origin of the State.
