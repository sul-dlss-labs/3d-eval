No attempt was made by the excavator to estimate the original height; in the model it is estimated at ~4.7m to match the hypothesized height of similarly sized monuments and to acknowledge the high height of the remaining brickwork at 2.5m. None of the the upper portions of the mastabas with exterior niching were preserved at Saqqara; the design of this part of the monument in the model is highly hypothetical, based on Early Dynastic palace façade imagery that shows some type of flat panel between the most deeply recessed niches, with the shallower niched areas extending higher, as visualized more elaborately in Emery (1954: pl. 39). Emery suggested that the entrance courtyard was an (unroofed) open court, and this was hypothetically reconstructed slightly taller than the surrounding enclosure wall, which is shown as standing to its full height of 1.5m in the section drawing (1958: pl. 85). Emery’s dimensions for the superstructure were conflicting (niche size vs. total length vs. brick size given), so a generalized section of the palace façade with Emery’s approximate dimensions was created and scaled to match the total published width and length of the tomb. Emery reported that the central niches (total height of the inner recess measuring 1.72m) had slot holes for wooden rollers found in one large niche at a height of 1.5m; these were added to the model and can be seen in the renders, although the wood texture was removed in the online application due to display issues.In Dynasty 5, the mastaba (as well as all the Dynasty 1 mastaba tombs) is replaced in the model by a deflated ruin; any elaborate niching, polychrome paint, and enclosures are replaced by a solid rectangular structure, shorter than the original, to represent the possible melting and collapse of the brick structure. The exact dating and duration for this process is unclear, but Emery’s excavations show that in Dynasties 2–3 new tombs were already built against and even over the earliest structures, suggesting that the deflation process was rapid and certainly took place before the end of the Old Kingdom.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
