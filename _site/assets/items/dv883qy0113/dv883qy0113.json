(2004: 22–27) was used primarily for the model dimensions and texturing. In modern times, the walls stand to a maximum height of 80cm; the reconstructed height of the walls and roof was based on the size of the columns in the portico, which Ockinga et al. reconstructed to an original height of 2m (plus base and architrave), here estimated to 2.5–2.7m. The eastern gateway entrance of this tomb is not preserved in modern times; the model reconstruction follows the conclusions of Ockinga et al. (2004: 26–27), which suggested that there was a central gate approximately 2m wide; limestone door jambs have been added to the model based on comparative tombs.The pyramidion of the tomb, now in the Cairo Museum (Ockinga et al. 2004: pls. 32–33) demonstrated that the sanctuary was originally capped with a pyramid (not preserved in modern times); the capstone was made of limestone and measured 37cm tall (Rammant-Peeters 1983: 23–24). The mud-brick pyramid in the model is reconstructed based on similar New Kingdom temple tombs from Dynasty 18.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
