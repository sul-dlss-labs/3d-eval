This model visualizes the tomb in Dynasty 18, with the limestone entrance doorway on a central axis (later demolished for the pyramid of Tia). The 3D model reconstruction was based on the description and plans in Martin et al. (2001: 1–6 and pl. 1); the 3D model is a highly simplified version of the monument.The walls of the tomb were preserved in modern times to a height of 2.13 m, but it is not clear if this was the full original height of the walls, so they have been reconstructed higher (to a minimum of 2.68m) to reflect that this was not likely the full extent of the walls. The material for the roof of the inner courtyard was unknown; unlike the inner courtyards of Tia or Horemheb (which had limestone revetments and stone pillars), Ramose’s interior had no architectural features that would have supported a stone roof slab. The roofing was thus textured with a dark brown color rather than a texture reflecting a material in order to indicate uncertainty in this construction. Two column bases were found in the central sanctuary; these have been hypothetically reconstructed as limestone columns, similar to that of other tombs from Dynasties 18–19 in this area; the original pyramid that likely capped the sanctuary area of this tomb (whose original presence is evident from the “massive proportions of the mud brick core walls of the sanctuary”) was not preserved (Martin et al. 2001: 3), but it was reconstructed hypothetically here following similar proportions to the neighboring pyramid of Meryneith.","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"contributor":[],"event":[],"form":[],"language":[],"note":[],"identifier":[],"subject":[],"relatedResource":[]},{"type":"part of","displayLabel":"Part of publication","title":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Sullivan, Elaine A.
